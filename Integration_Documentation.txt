Integration Process:
1. Imported data from the MySQL database into Excel using Microsoft Query.
2. Verified that the data pulled from the database matches the data entered in the database tables.
3. Created a Pivot Table to summarize water usage across regions.
4. Built a dashboard that allows users to filter by region or access type to view insights.
5. Validated the dashboard by cross-referencing data from SQL queries and Excel output.

Testing:
- Ensured all fields in the Pivot Table correctly correspond to the database fields.
- Validated the chart by comparing values with raw SQL queries.
